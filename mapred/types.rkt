;; Note the EOD marker is the exclusive marker of the position of the last record.
;; It may (most likely) indicates a position inside the last record.
;; Therefore a Reader of a Block should read past EOD until the record is complete and then no further.
;; As a corollary a block must extend past the EOD position at least 1 Record length in size.
;; This all works as a Reader reads the first complete record of a block and the last record which contains the EOD position.
;; All contigous blocks therefore must overlap by at least one MAX-RECORD-LENGTH.
;; All trouble is because we are assuming the persisted data API being used supports offset reading.
;; such as S3 and an OS.
;; A Block is a chunk of semi/structured data subject to manipulation
